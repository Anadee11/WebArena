<h2><p>I quickly wrote a python program to play text based snake and ladder game in terminal.

Any advance python concept is not used in this code. However it is a fun thing to do for a beginner in order to learn how to use multiple concepts in your program.

Few basic concepts used in this code are:
    - Dictionary
    - List
    - Generating random number
    - Selecting a Random value from a list
    - Adding wait/sleep in program
    - Conditional Statements i.e. IF and ELSE
    - Getting input from user



You can download the code from Github.



What is happening in Game:
    - Display the welcome message
    - Collect the player's names
    - Until one of the player wins do the following:
        - Roll the dice
        - Move the player forward for the value got on dice roll.
        - If player is on snake's head, move down to its tail
        - If player is on ladder's bottom, take it to its top
        - else remain there and let second player roll the dice

You can set the value SLEEP_BETWEEN_ACTIONS to 0 if you do not want any delay while playing game.
